[h1]Current Features[/h1]

[b]Automated Naming Convention[/b]:
Each line name follows this structure:
[code] [Transport Type] - [(Cargo Types)]: [First Town Initials] - [Last Town Initials] [Line Type] #[Count] [/code]

[i]Components of the Naming Convention:[/i] [list] [*][b]Transport Type[/b]: Abbreviation based on transport mode (e.g., RC for Road Cargo, TP for Train Passenger). [*][b]Cargo Types[/b]: If applicable, displays the types of cargo in parentheses (e.g., (Grain)), or is left blank for passenger-only lines. [*][b]Town Initials[/b]: Up to three-letter initials of the starting and ending towns (e.g., Spr for Springfield). [*][b]Line Type[/b]: [list] [*][b]LO (Local)[/b]: A line that operates within a single town, typically shorter routes such as urban buses or short-distance trams. [*][b]IC (Intercity)[/b]: A line that connects two distinct towns, often medium-range routes like regional trains, intercity buses, or cargo trucks between two locations. [*][b]RE (Regional)[/b]: A line that passes through three or more towns, typically longer routes covering multiple cities or regions, like express trains or multi-stop cargo routes. [/list] [*][b]Count[/b]: If multiple lines share the same name, a unique count (e.g., #1, #2) is added to avoid duplicates. [/list]

[i]Examples[/i]:
[list] [*]Road Cargo Line: [i]RC - (Grain): Spr - Cap IC #1[/i] [*]Passenger Train Line: [i]TP - Spr - She IC[/i] [*]Air Passenger Line: [i]AP - Cap - Ogd LO[/i] [/list]

[b]Transport Type Detection[/b]: Differentiates between passenger and cargo lines across all transport types, with shorthand for each mode.

[b]Renaming Options[/b]:
[list] [*][b]Manual Refresh[/b]: Set a line’s name to [i]"reload"[/i] or [i]"r"[/i] to trigger an automatic renaming based on the current route and transport type. [*][b]Default Naming[/b]: Lines with default values (e.g., [i]"Line 1"[/i], [i]"Line 2"[/i]) or prefixed with [i]"UNK"[/i] are automatically renamed. [*][b]Tag Exclusion[/b]: Use the [i][NoAuto][/i] tag to exclude lines from auto-renaming. [/list]

[h1]Upcoming Features[/h1]

[list] [*][b]In-Game Customization GUI[/b]: Directly adjust naming conventions, logging levels, and tag exclusions in-game. [*][b]Additional Naming Patterns[/b]: More flexible patterns, including customizable prefixes and suffixes. [*][b]Support for Custom Cargo Types[/b]: Enhanced detection for modded or custom cargo types to improve naming accuracy. [/list]

[h1]How to Use[/h1]

Install the Mod:
Subscribe on the Steam Workshop and enable it in Transport Fever 2’s mod settings.

Create a New Line:
Set up a line as usual. ALN will automatically generate a name based on its details.

Rename Existing Lines:
ALN renames existing lines with default or placeholder names. You can also rename a line by setting its name to [i]"reload"[/i] or [i]"r"[/i].

[h1]Troubleshooting and Tips[/h1]

[b]Why is my line not renamed?[/b]
The line may already have a custom name or might not meet renaming conditions (e.g., no assigned stops). Set the line name to [i]"reload"[/i] or [i]"r"[/i] to force a renaming.

[b]How do I exclude a line from renaming?[/b]
Use the [i][NoAuto][/i] tag in the line name to prevent auto-renaming.
